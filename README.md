Copy of files for project3

In Project 3 I firslty forked the files from the given repository, I than connected to the azure database. I checked if everything was working fine up until that point.
I created the 3 repository classes as well as their interfaces, and changed the data in the controller classes.
I added Services in the controllers and repository, but this caused some errors to be fixed.
I than published the web app using azure.

Direction of use:
The appp can be accessed through a link.
The user has to registewr using an email and a unique password.
There are 3 sections in which enteries can be added andd deleted.
